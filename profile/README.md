# Master Thesis: Feasibility of Deep Learning-based Methods for the Classification of Real and Simulated Electrocardiogram Signals

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for my master's thesis work. This organization hosts all the code developed during my research on the feasibility of deep learning-based methods for classifying real and simulated electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Below you will find the details of the three repositories that constitute the core of this work.

Repositories:

1. [DataManagement](https://github.com/Detecting-Simulated-Real-ECG-Signals/DataManagement)
    * A comprehensive data management tool designed to store and version time series data efficiently.
    * Key features:
        * Data storage solutions for large-scale time series data.
        * Version control mechanisms for data management.

2. [Preprocessing](https://github.com/Detecting-Simulated-Real-ECG-Signals/Preprocessing)
    * A suite of preprocessing methods aimed at enhancing the quality of the ECG database.
    * Key features:
        * Techniques for noise reduction and signal enhancement.
        * Methods for data normalization and feature extraction.

3. [Detection of Real and Simulated ECGs](https://github.com/Detecting-Simulated-Real-ECG-Signals/DataManagement)
    * This repository contains the code for the deep learning models and scripts used to train and test the classification models.
    * Key features:
        * Implementation of various deep learning architectures for ECG classification.
        * Training scripts with hyperparameter tuning options.
        * Testing and evaluation scripts to assess model performance.
